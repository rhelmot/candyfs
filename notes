for thread safety:

- need to lock each individual inumber on the level of the exported functions in inodes.c
- need to lock the data and inumber freelists in storage_structures.c
- need to lock dir write operations
- need namei and friends to pass around open-file handles to stuff so they don't get deleted out from under the reference
- need to lock all operations on the open file table
